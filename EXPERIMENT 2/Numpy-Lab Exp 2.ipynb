    "Assess the performance trends of students across different subjects, focusing on data imperfections such as missing values, duplicates, and the need to uniquely identify records.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective Scenario:\n",
    "A high school intends to analyze semester results to enhance teaching strategies and provide targeted support. The dataset includes student roll numbers but contains issues like missing entries and duplicates that must be addressed for accurate analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset:\n",
    "Data is provided as a Python list containing tuples for each student's roll number followed by their scores in Mathematics, Science, and English. The list includes missing entries (represented as None) and intentionally duplicated records. Example: [(101, 45, 78, None), (102, 65, 56, 77), (103, 95, 85, 92), (102, 65, 56, 77), (104, 45, None, 88), (101, 45, 78, None)].\n",

    "Data Normalization:\n",
    "Apply min-max normalization to the scores (excluding roll numbers) to scale them between 0 and 1. This adjustment facilitates fair comparisons across different subjects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical Analysis:\n",
    "Calculate the normalized mean, median, and standard deviation of scores for each subject.\n",
